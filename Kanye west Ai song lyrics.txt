Fuck Pete.

Fuck him and all his friends.

That ain't my life.

Fuck the world but your girl's my favorite.

I'm better off without you, Fuck that.


I ain't even trippin' 'cause I got my mind right and i'm at peace

Feel better 'cause I'm finally happy, no stress no tears of regret

Broke the chains, broke the pattern but still hold on to my daughter's hand


I'm happier than ever i've been successful

You see when you cut the ribbon off of a mansion

And you living in the past, cause it all ends up negative

Happier than ever ive never been so happy before

Since the cop left me with no case in my hand
